                    <p>Welcome to my page.</p>
                    <p> First of all, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Thin Thazin. I am originally from Myanmar also known as Burma. Currently,I am studying Computer Science Major at LaGuardia Community College and living in Woodheaven, Queens. </p>
                    <p> Since I am a college student, I have to budget on food. I usually eat out and my favorite is spicy food. The main purpose of this website is to share the low-budget Asian restaurants around Queens based on my experiences. In the review section, I wrote the review of the food I ate and also recommmend which food you should try when you get there.
                    Besides, it would be convenient not only for the LaGuardia Students but also those who wanted to try diverse Asian food.</p>
                    <p>I am sure that you guys know more Asian restaurants than I mentioned in here.But for some of the people who doesn't know here is the list of Asian restaurants I am going to talk about.</p>
